# Hi there! I'm Francisco Neto 👋

### 🇯🇵 Software Engineer | Python, Cloud & DevOps Specialist

---

I am a highly motivated Software Engineer focused on building scalable, robust, and containerized backend systems.

My goal is to leverage my expertise in modern cloud architecture to contribute to innovative tech companies.

### 🛠️ Core Tech Stack & Expertise

My current focus and expertise are centered around the following technologies, which I apply in all my portfolio projects:

| Category | Technologies | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL | Building high-performance, testable RESTful APIs. |
| **Cloud** | AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM) | Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Managed Services. |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), CI/CD (GitHub Actions) | Containerization, Orchestration, and Automated Deployment Pipelines. |
| **Data** | Pandas, Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Requests) | Data collection, processing, and integration with backend systems. |

### 🚀 Featured Project: Scalable Data Scraper API

This project demonstrates my full-stack expertise from data collection to cloud deployment.

*   **Description:** A robust, containerized API that scrapes data, processes it with Python/Pandas, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
*   **Architecture:** The application is built with **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**, containerized with **Docker**, and orchestrated using **Kubernetes** (K8s).
*   **Deployment:** Deployed on **AWS** with a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** via GitHub Actions.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Python, FastAPI, Docker, K8s, PostgreSQL, AWS, CI/CD.
