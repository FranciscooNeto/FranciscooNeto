I am a highly motivated Software Engineer focused on building scalable, robust, and containerized backend systems. I am currently pursuing an intensive 5-month program to master the most in-demand tech stack in the Japanese market, aiming for a Highly Skilled Professional (HSP) visa sponsorship.

My goal is to leverage my expertise in modern cloud architecture to contribute to innovative tech companies in Japan.

### 🛠️ Core Tech Stack & Expertise

My current focus and expertise are centered around the following technologies, which I apply in all my portfolio projects:

| Category | Technologies | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL | Building high-performance, testable RESTful APIs. |
| **Cloud** | AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM) | Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Managed Services. |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), CI/CD (GitHub Actions) | Containerization, Orchestration, and Automated Deployment Pipelines. |
| **Data** | Pandas, Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Requests) | Data collection, processing, and integration with backend systems. |

### 🚀 Featured Project: Scalable Data Scraper API

This project demonstrates my full-stack expertise from data collection to cloud deployment.

*   **Description:** A robust, containerized API that scrapes data, processes it with Python/Pandas, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
